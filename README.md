# Enhanced Learned Bloom Filter

A comprehensive implementation of Enhanced Learned Bloom Filters that addresses three critical problems in traditional Learned Bloom Filters: poor cache locality, expensive retraining, and unstable false positive rates.

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an enhanced version of Learned Bloom Filters (LBF) that combines machine learning with traditional probabilistic data structures to achieve:

- **Lowest FPR** - 0.2% average (5x better than Standard Bloom Filter)
- **O(1) update complexity** - 0.007ms per update with incremental learning
- **±10% FPR variance** - Stable performance through adaptive control
- **Cache-optimized architecture** - 64-byte alignment, SIMD vectorization

## 📊 Key Features

### Three Core Enhancements

1. **Cache-Aligned Memory Layout**
   - 64-byte aligned blocks matching CPU cache lines
   - SIMD vectorization for batch operations
   - Reduces cache misses from 70% to ~25%

2. **Incremental Online Learning**
   - Passive-Aggressive classifier for O(1) updates
   - Sliding window and reservoir sampling
   - Eliminates expensive O(n) retraining

3. **Adaptive Threshold Control**
   - PID controller for FPR stabilization
   - Real-time monitoring and adjustment
   - Maintains stable performance under varying workloads

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BloomFilter.git
cd BloomFilter

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.enhanced_lbf.combined import CombinedEnhancedLBF

# Create enhanced filter with all optimizations
filter = CombinedEnhancedLBF(
    initial_positive_set=positive_items,
    initial_negative_set=negative_items,
    target_fpr=0.01,
    enable_cache_opt=True,
    enable_incremental=True,
    enable_adaptive=True
)

# Add items (O(1) complexity)
filter.add("new_item", label=1)

# Query items
if filter.query("test_item"):
    print("Item might be in the set")

# Batch operations (SIMD optimized)
results = filter.batch_query(["item1", "item2", "item3"])

# Get statistics
stats = filter.get_stats()
print(f"Cache hit rate: {stats['cache_hit_rate']:.1f}%")
```

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Lowest FPR achieved** - 0.2% average across real-world datasets (5x better than Standard BF)
2. **O(1) incremental updates** - Eliminates expensive retraining bottleneck
3. **Adaptive control stabilizes FPR** - ±10% variance vs ±800% in basic LBF
4. **Trade-offs are real** - 12x throughput penalty for superior accuracy
5. **Methodology matters** - Fixed data leakage issue in testing (see [docs/METHODOLOGY.md](docs/METHODOLOGY.md))

## ⚠️ Important Note on Testing

**October 25, 2025 Update**: We discovered and fixed a data leakage issue in the original testing methodology where training and test sets had 100% overlap. The corrected methodology uses proper 80/20 train/test split with no overlap. **FPR results improved** with the fix (0.1-0.3% vs 0.6-0.9% previously). See [docs/METHODOLOGY.md](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) for details.
