## Failure Modes

### Standard Bloom Filter

❌ **Cannot delete items** - requires full rebuild  
❌ **Fixed size** - oversizing wastes memory, undersizing increases FPR  
❌ **No adaptation** - FPR degrades with overfilling

### Counting Bloom Filter

❌ **Counter overflow** - 4-bit counters max at 15  
❌ **Higher memory** - 8x overhead vs standard  
❌ **False deletions** - removing duplicates causes errors

### Scalable Bloom Filter

❌ **Performance degradation** - queries check all sub-filters  
❌ **Memory overhead** - multiple filters compound size  
❌ **No deletion** - growth is one-way

### Cuckoo Filter

❌ **Insertion failures** - can fail when full (~95% load)  
❌ **Higher FPR** - 2-3x worse than Bloom filters  
❌ **Kick loops** - excessive relocations degrade performance

### Vacuum Filter

❌ **Uneven sharding** - poor hash distribution causes imbalance  
❌ **Cross-shard queries** - some use cases need all shards  
❌ **Complexity** - harder to reason about than single filter

### Basic Learned BF

❌ **Poor generalization** - struggles with generic data  
❌ **Retraining cost** - O(n) rebuild on updates  
❌ **FPR instability** - ±800% variance under load

### Enhanced Learned BF

❌ **High memory** - 10MB for ML model and features  
❌ **Lower throughput** - 12x slower than standard  
❌ **Complex tuning** - many hyperparameters to adjust
