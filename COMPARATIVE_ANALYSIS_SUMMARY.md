2. Measured insertion time for all elements
3. Queried 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative samples
4. Calculated FPR, throughput, and memory usage
5. Repeated for three dataset sizes

### Implementation Notes
- All filters implemented in Python 3.13
- Used MurmurHash3 for hashing
- Single-threaded execution
- No GPU acceleration

## Conclusions

The comparative analysis reveals **no single winner across all dimensions**:

- **For raw speed**: Choose Cuckoo Filter (2.5M queries/sec)
- **For accuracy**: Choose Standard/Counting BF (1.0-1.2% FPR)
- **For memory**: Choose Cuckoo Filter (0.05 MB)
- **For features**: Choose Enhanced LBF (O(1) updates, adaptive)
- **For simplicity**: Choose Standard BF

The Enhanced Learned Bloom Filter, while showing poor results on synthetic data, demonstrates unique capabilities:
- ‚úÖ O(1) incremental updates validated
- ‚úÖ Cache-aligned architecture implemented
- ‚úÖ Adaptive FPR control mechanism working
- ‚ùå Requires proper feature engineering for good FPR

## Next Steps

1. **Optimize Enhanced LBF** for generic data
2. **Implement GPU versions** for massive parallelism
3. **Test with real-world datasets** (URLs, IPs, etc.)
4. **Create hybrid implementations** combining strengths
5. **Benchmark distributed versions** for cloud deployment
